# AI-Nable: Breaking Barriers in Education
## AWS Breaking Barriers Virtual Challenge Submission

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

### The Digital Divide in Education
Students with learning differences (ADHD, dyslexia, low literacy) face significant barriers when accessing complex educational materials. Traditional text-heavy content creates anxiety, shame, and fear of failure, leading to disengagement and poor academic outcomes. These students need personalized, multimodal learning experiences that adapt to their unique cognitive processing styles.

### The Challenge
How can we leverage AWS generative AI and connectivity to create equitable digital learning experiences that break down these barriers and enable all students to succeed?

### Impact Scope
- **15% of students** have learning differences that affect their ability to process traditional educational content
- **40% higher dropout rates** among students with learning disabilities
- **$2.3 billion** annual cost to education systems due to learning barriers
- **Global accessibility gap** affecting millions of students worldwide
