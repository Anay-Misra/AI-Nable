# Bug Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. PDF Upload Issues

**Problem**: Some PDFs were failing with "UnsupportedDocumentException" when using AWS Textract.

**Root Cause**: AWS Textract has limitations on certain PDF formats, particularly:
- Scanned PDFs (images of text)
- PDFs with complex layouts
- Corrupted or malformed PDFs
- PDFs that are too large

**Solution Implemented**:
- Added specific exception handling for different Textract errors:
  - `UnsupportedDocumentException`: Better error message with suggestions
  - `DocumentTooLargeException`: Clear size limit information
  - `BadDocumentException`: Corruption detection
- Improved error messages with actionable suggestions for users
- Added validation to ensure extracted text is not empty

**Code Changes**:
```python
try:
    response = textract_client.detect_document_text(Document={'Bytes': content})
    # ... text extraction logic
except textract_client.exceptions.UnsupportedDocumentException:
    raise HTTPException(
        status_code=400,
        detail="This document format is not supported by our text extraction service. Please try: 1) A different PDF file, 2) An image file (JPG, PNG), or 3) Ensure the PDF contains readable text (not scanned images)."
    )
```

### 2. Visual Storytelling Issues

**Problem**: Text-to-image generation was failing with "ValidationException" because the text exceeded the 512 character limit.

**Root Cause**: The Titan image generator has a strict 512 character limit for the text parameter, but the code wasn't properly calculating and truncating the text.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Implemented proper text length calculation:
  - Base prompt: ~205 characters
  - Available for content: ~307 characters (512 - 205)
  - Set max content length to 300 characters with buffer
- Added intelligent truncation at word boundaries
- Added emergency truncation if still too long
- Added logging to debug prompt length issues
- Added specific error handling for ValidationException

**Code Changes**:
```python
# Calculate available space for the content text
max_content_length = 300  # Leave some buffer

# Truncate the simplified text to fit within the limit
image_prompt_text = simplified_text[:max_content_length]
if len(simplified_text) > max_content_length:
    # Try to truncate at a word boundary
    last_space = image_prompt_text.rfind(' ')
    if last_space > max_content_length * 0.7:
        image_prompt_text = image_prompt_text[:last_space]

# Verify the total prompt length
if len(prompt) > 512:
    # Emergency truncation if still too long
    excess = len(prompt) - 512
    image_prompt_text = image_prompt_text[:-excess-10]
```

## Testing

Created and ran comprehensive tests to verify fixes:

1. **Visual Storytelling Test**: Tests with long text to ensure it stays within limits
2. **Error Handling Test**: Tests proper rejection of unsupported file types
3. **Backend Health Check**: Ensures the server is running correctly

**Test Results**:
- ✅ Visual storytelling test passed
- ✅ Error handling test passed  
- ✅ Backend health check passed

## Impact

### Before Fixes:
- PDF uploads would fail silently or with generic errors
- Visual storytelling would fail with cryptic validation errors
- Users had no guidance on how to resolve issues

### After Fixes:
- Clear, actionable error messages for PDF upload issues
- Visual storytelling works reliably with proper text truncation
- Better logging for debugging
- Graceful handling of edge cases

## Recommendations for Users

### For PDF Upload Issues:
1. Ensure PDFs contain readable text (not scanned images)
2. Try converting scanned PDFs to text using OCR tools first
3. Use image files (JPG, PNG) as alternatives
4. Keep file sizes under 25MB

### For Visual Storytelling:
- The system now automatically handles long texts
- No user action required - truncation is automatic
- Images are generated with proper prompts

## Files Modified

1. `backend/main.py` - Main backend logic with error handling and text truncation
2. `test_backend.py` - Updated test script to verify fixes

## Next Steps

1. Monitor backend logs for any remaining issues
2. Consider implementing OCR fallback for scanned PDFs
3. Add more comprehensive error handling for other edge cases
4. Consider implementing retry logic for transient AWS service issues
